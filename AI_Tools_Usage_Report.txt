PART 2: AI Tools & LLMs (Bonus)

Tools Used:
- ChatGPT
- GitHub Copilot

1. Prompts or Ways I Used AI:
- "Generate a backend Express.js route for updating a job application with MongoDB."
- "Suggest filtering logic for a job tracker app based on status and job type using React and Redux."
- "Optimize my MongoDB query for listing job applications sorted by date."
- "Create a confirmation modal using Tailwind CSS and React for delete functionality."

2. How It Helped (or Didnâ€™t):
- Code Generation: Helped speed up boilerplate code creation for routes, models, and filtering logic.
- Bug Fixing: ChatGPT helped identify a logic bug in my filtering function.
- Optimization Tips: Provided guidance on optimizing my MongoDB queries and Redux state updates.
- UI Suggestions: Assisted with Tailwind class combinations for consistent styling and responsive layout.

Overall, AI tools significantly improved development speed and gave me clarity during roadblocks, especially with backend integration and frontend conditional rendering.

3. Manual Changes I Made After Using the Tool:
- Adjusted route handlers to match my schema structure and validation needs.
- Modified generated Tailwind classes to better align with my design system.
- Updated state management logic from vanilla React to Redux Toolkit structure.
- Added custom error handling and success toast notifications based on real-time testing.
